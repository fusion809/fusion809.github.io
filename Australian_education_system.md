In Australia, education is split into four main categories &mdash; pre-primary, primary, secondary (also known as high school) and tertiary. Although, the Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade instead categorizes education in Australia as primary (which includes what I categorize as pre-primary), secondary, senior secondary and tertiary (Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 2017).

# Pre-primary education
Pre-primary education consists of kindergarten followed by preschool (also called preparatory or prep) (*Kindergarten*, 2021; Queensland Government, 2017). In Queensland, kindergarten usually begins within about six months of students turning four years of age (*Kindergarten*, 2023), whereas preschool usually begins within about six months of students turning five years of age (Queensland Government, 2017). Kindergarten is a part-time educational programme that consists of about 15 hours per week and 40 weeks per year of education (Queensland Government Department of Education, 2023). Preschool is studied full time, usually Monday to Friday from 9am to 3pm (Queensland Government, 2017). Preschool is compulsory at least in Queensland (Queensland Government, 2017). As of 1 January 2024, government-approved kindergarten programmes are free for Queensland children (Queensland Government Department of Education, 2023).

# Schooling
Primary and secondary education are considered schooling, which comes in year levels numbered from one to twelve. Year 1 usually begins within six months of a student turning six years old. School is compulsory until a student completes year 10 and then the student is required to participate full time in further education, training or employment until they are at least age 17. In 2016, 80.9% of male students and 87.8% of female students that start high school complete year 12 (Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 2017).

Up until the end of secondary education, students are usually minors and expected to refer to their teachers by formal titles like Mr &lt;surname&gt; for male teachers and Mrs or Ms &lt;surname&gt; for female teachers. 

## Primary education
Primary education consists of the first six years of schooling; previously (at least until the late 2000s) this was the first seven years of schooling. At this stage of schooling, students usually have just one teacher covering all subjects, except perhaps music and sports. These teachers typically have either a bachelor's or master's degree in primary education. 

## Secondary education
Secondary education consists of the final six years of schooling. At this stage of schooling, different teachers cover different subjects which pertain to one broad field (e.g. mathematics, science, English, physical education, etc.) for the most part. Teachers at this stage of education typically have at least two degrees (typically either bachelor's or master's degree) &mdash; a degree in the field they teach, or a related field, and a degree in secondary education. In early years of secondary school, students usually do not have much choice about which subjects they take, although this increases the further into secondary education they go. Years 11 and 12 are categorized as senior secondary (Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 2017) and in these years, students typically get to choose each subject they take although they are required to take at at least one English subject and at least one mathematics subject. Additionally, the subjects students take at this level help to decide what tertiary education programmes they can pursue after secondary school.

# Tertiary education
Tertiary education consists of higher education and vocational education and training (VET). Both of which are categorized into ten levels numbered from one to ten by the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF). 

## VET
In Australia, VET is predominantly provided by Technical and Further Education institutions (TAFEs) and registered training organizations (RTOs), which are predominantly publicly and privately funded, respectively. Although, VET is also provided by some institutions that call themselves universities like Central Queensland University (CQU). VET is designed to prepare students for vocations which includes technical jobs, skilled crafts or trades. 

VET institutions can also provide qualifications that prepare students for certain professions and paraprofessions like accounting and enrolled nursing (TAFE Queensland, n.d.-a, n.d.-b).

## Higher education
Higher education is predominantly provided by universities in Australia, which are usually publicly funded. According to Study Australia (of the Australian Government Department of Education), Australia is home to 37 public universities, 3 private Australian universities and 2 private international universities (Study Australia, n.d.). Higher education can prepare students for more highly skilled jobs, such as professions and paraprofessions. 

## AQF
### VET certificates
Levels one to four of the AQF are reserved for VET certificates. These certificates are also numbered one to four (with Roman numerals). Certificate I are level one qualifications, Certificate II are level two qualifications, Certificate III are level three qualifications, and Certificate IV are level four qualifications. These certificates can be undertaken before the completion of secondary education. At my school, for instance, senior students (year 11 and 12) had every Wednesday off to study VET courses. The entry requirements of these programmes varies markedly, some require the completion of year 10 (TAFE Queensland, n.d.-c) and others have no formal entry requirements (TAFE Queensland, n.d.-d).

I cannot name any jobs that require a Certificate I or II and as I understand it, they are sometimes undertaken to just show the person has an interest in the field they are in, or maybe to upgrade the person's status in a workplace relevant to them. Certificate III is usually the minimum entry requirement for most trades (Australian Government, 2021a, 2021c, 2021e). As I understand it, Certificate IV is usually required to work in managerial positions within the trades, although I have not been able to find a reference for this so it may be wrong.

Certificates I and II typically take no more than a year to complete (Australian Qualifications Framework Council, 2013). Certificate III and IV can be undertaken as part of an apprenticeship (Australian Qualifications Framework Council, 2013). Certificate III typically take one to two years to complete, or up to four years if completed as part of an apprenticeship (Australian Qualifications Framework Council, 2013). Certificate IV typically takes half a year up to two years to complete (Australian Qualifications Framework Council, 2013).

### Higher education qualifications
Levels five and above are reserved for higher education qualifications. Although, some of these qualifications can be offered by VET institutions too. Undergraduate certificates were introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic and are short (usually about six months) level five to seven qualifications and are due to be phased out in 2025 (Australian Trade and Investment Commission, n.d.-a). Universities also offer non-award study programmes that can be useful for gaining entry into level five to seven qualifications. My university, the University of Southern Queensland (UniSQ), offers a programme of study that is officially called the "Tertiary Preparation Pathway" (University of Southern Queensland, n.d.-b). 

There are two main types of higher education subjects: coursework and research. Coursework subjects are subjects with a set syllabus the student is meant to learn and students are graded on how well they have learned this syllabus. Coursework subjects can also include placements. Research subjects are subjects in which students undertake academic research and in so doing produce new knowledge. Level five to seven qualifications are almost universally coursework-based. Some level eight and nine qualifications are coursework-based and others are research-based and some are a combination of the two. Level ten qualifications are all universally research-based, although they can include some coursework too.

Academic research in the context of a degree programme culminates in the submission of a thesis. There are three different kinds of theses: standard, by publication (or compilation) and by creative works (Australian National University, 2016a; University of Southern Queensland, 2022a). A thesis by publication includes, as chapters, works (usually papers) that have been expressly prepared for publication (Australian National University, 2016a; University of Southern Queensland, 2022a). A thesis by creative works can include a multimedia or digital work, film, musical composition or some other creative work (Australian National University, 2016a; University of Southern Queensland, 2022a). The word count requirements also differs by the type of thesis (Australian National University, 2016a; University of Southern Queensland, 2022a). 

Level five qualifications consists of diplomas (Australian Qualifications Framework Council, 2013). Level six qualifications consists of advanced diplomas and associate degrees (Australian Qualifications Framework Council, 2013). Level seven qualifications consist of bachelor's degrees (Australian Qualifications Framework Council, 2013). Level eight qualifications are graduate certificates, graduate diplomas and honours degrees (Australian Qualifications Framework Council, 2013). Level nine qualifications are master's degrees and level ten qualifications are doctoral degrees (Australian Qualifications Framework Council, 2013). 

#### Diploma, advanced diploma and associate degree
A diploma typically takes about a year of full-time study to complete (Australian Qualifications Framework Council, 2013). An advanced diploma typically takes about 1.5-2 years to complete when studied full-time (Australian Qualifications Framework Council, 2013). An associate degree typically takes 2 years to complete when studied full-time (Australian Qualifications Framework Council, 2013). 

A diploma in accounting is the minimum qualification required to be an accountant, although most accountants have bachelor's degrees (Australian Government, 2021b). A diploma or advanced diploma in nursing is the minimum qualification required to be an enrolled nurse (Australian Government, 2021d). An associate degree is a more theory-based qualification than a diploma or advanced diploma and is usually used as a means of gaining entry into a bachelor's degree when students do not meet the entry requirements. I cannot name any job with an associate degree as the minimum entry requirement. 

#### Bachelor's degree
Bachelor's degrees are the minimum entry-level qualifications for most professions, including but not limited to:
* Teaching of both primary and secondary school students.
* Medicine and surgery.
* Dentistry.
* Veterinary medicine.
* Law.
* Optometry.
* Physiotherapy.
* Engineering (typically these degrees are classified as bachelor's honours degrees).
These qualifications typically require three to four years of full-time study (Australian Qualifications Framework Council, 2013) and are the highest qualification that students are eligible to enter straight after high school. Accelerated bachelor's degree programmes do exist that can be completed in as little as two years (Bond University, n.d.). Some bachelor's degree programmes (sometimes considered bachelor's honours degree programmes) can take up to six years, such as James Cook University (JCU)'s Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degree programme (James Cook University, n.d.).

All qualifications at levels eight or above require at least a bachelor's degree to gain entry into.

#### Graduate certificate, graduate diploma and honours degrees
Each of these qualifications have an entry requirement of a bachelor's degree, some also have minimum grade point average (GPA) or weighted average mark (WAM) requirements for that bachelor's degree. Honours degrees and graduate diplomas typically take one year of full-time study to complete whereas graduate certificates typically take about six months to complete. Graduate certificates and graduate diplomas are predominantly coursework qualifications, whereas honours degrees often include a research project and end in the submission of a 10,000 to 20,000 word thesis. 

Honours degrees can be completed as separate degrees or as the final year of a combined bachelor's honours degree programme. Honours degrees are graded as first-class honours if the student's WAM is at least 80%, division A second-class honours if the student's WAM is at least 75% and less than 80%, division B second-class honours if the student's WAM is at least 70% and less than 75% and third-class honours if the student's WAM is at least 65% and less than 70%. They are usually indicated in brackets as "honours" after the name of the bachelor's degree they were preceded by. For instance, if someone did a Bachelor of Science degree followed by an honours degree the two degrees would be indicated as "Bachelor of Science (Honours)". 

Division A second-class honours or better is typically required for entry into a professional or research doctorate programme (The University of Melbourne, n.d.; University of New South Wales, n.d.; University of Southern Queensland, n.d.-a). An honours degree is typically required for entry into a Master of Philosophy degree programme (Queensland University of Technology, n.d.). I cannot really list any job that requires an honours degree specifically, their main purpose is for helping students to get into research degrees. 

I cannot name any jobs that require a graduate diploma or certificate, as I understand it they are typically completed as a way of showing an interest in the field they are in and maybe to upgrade a person's status in the workplace. Students that fail to complete a master's degree by coursework but manage to complete at least some of coursework may graduate with a graduate certificate or diploma. 

#### Master's degree
AQF recognizes three types of master's degree &mdash; master's degrees by coursework (MDCs), master's degrees by research (MDRs) and extended master's degrees (EMDs) (Australian Qualifications Framework Council, 2013). 

An MDC and an MDR typically takes one to two years full-time study to complete, whereas an EMD typically takes three to four years of full-time study to complete (Australian Qualifications Framework Council, 2013). An MDC is typically predominantly composed of coursework as the name suggests, but it often also includes a research project that ends in the submission of a 12,000 to 20,000 word thesis for examination (Australian National University, 2016; Australian Qualifications Framework Council, 2013; Australian Trade and Investment Commission, n.d.-b). As the name suggests, an MDR is predominantly composed of research which also culminates in the submission of a 20,000 to 60,000 word thesis for examination (Australian Qualifications Framework Council, 2013; Australian Trade and Investment Commission, n.d.-b; Victoria University, n.d.). In fact, the Master of Research I undertook at the UniSQ in 2023 was composed entirely of research and my thesis was about 35,600 words long. An EMD is typically designed to train a student for a particular profession (e.g. medicine, physiotherapy, optometry, veterinary medicine, dentistry or law) (Australian Qualifications Framework Council, 2013).

An MDC programme is typically titled "Master of &lt;field of study&gt;", an MDR programme may also be titled this way or as "Master of &lt;field of study&gt; (Research)" or as "Master of Research" (MRes), "Master by Research" or "Master of Philosophy (MPhil). EMDs typically have the word "doctor" in their names despite not being classified as doctorates. Examples include Juris Doctor (JD), Medicinae Doctor (MD), Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS), Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM), etc.

An MDR programme is categorized as a higher degree by research (HDR), which a category of degrees that share similar scholarship opportunities and similar structures. MPhil programmes are typically treated differently to other MDR programmes in that they typically require demonstrated previous research experience in order to gain entry (for which an honours degree will typically suffice) and they typically provide students the option to articulate into a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) programme.

The rest of these qualifications typically have a bachelor's degree as at least part of their entry requirement. I have seen some master's degrees in nursing that require a graduate diploma though and relevant work experience. 

#### Doctoral degree
The AQF recognizes three separate categories of doctoral degree &mdash; professional, research and higher. A defining characteristic of a doctoral degree is research. Each category of doctoral degree has a substantial research component.

Professional and research doctorates are both awarded after completing a programme of supervised research and study which is typically two to four years in duration when studied full-time. Both professional and research doctorates are HDRs and end in the submission of a thesis. 

In a professional doctorate, the student is required to make an original contribution to professional practice within their field through research. A professional doctorate thesis typically consist of 45,000 to 65,000 words (Australian Trade and Investment Commission, n.d.-b; Victoria University, n.d.). These programmes usually consist of at least a year of coursework. 

In a research doctorate, the student is required to make an original contribution to knowledge within their field through research. Research doctorates typically do not have much coursework. A research doctorate thesis is typically 50,000 to 100,000 words long (Australian National University, 2016b; Victoria University, n.d.). Professional doctorates are typically titled "Doctor of &lt;field of study&gt;" or "Doctor of Professional Studies". Research doctorates are typically titled, irrespective of the field they are in, "Doctor of Philosophy" (PhD).

Higher doctorates are not degree programmes that students enrol into, however. Instead a student wishing to be awarded a higher doctorate submits a portfolio of research they have conducted that has not been used to award them a degree in the past. This research typically is required to follow a consistent theme and must constitute an internationally recognized original and substantial contribution to one's field. In fact, it must be a more substantial contribution than that required for the awarding of a PhD. In order to be eligible to receive a higher doctorate, a student typically must have been awarded a research doctorate at least seven (or at some universities ten) years prior (University of Southern Queensland, 2022b). Higher doctorates are not typically classified as HDRs and students are typically required to pay the fees associated with being awarded the degree themselves. Like professional doctorates, higher doctorates are typically titled "Doctor of &lt;field of study&gt;".

# Covering tuition and other fees
In Queensland, kindergarten to senior secondary education is typically free for Queensland citizens at public institutions. TPP and similar non-award programmes as well as HDR programmes at public universities are typically free for domestic students and this is true not only in Queensland but across Australia. Some TAFE qualifications are free; this is mostly the case for entry-level qualifications for jobs for which there is a shortage.

Other university qualifications are typically not free, although the tuition can be substantially subsidized by the federal government through Commonwealth supported places (CSPs) (Australian Government Department of Education, 2023a). The rest of one's tuition can usually be covered by a interest-free (but indexed with inflation) loan called a HECS-HELP loan (Australian Government Department of Education, 2023b). When a CSP is not used to subsidize one's tuition, one can get a FEE-HELP loan instead (Australian Government Department of Education, 2024). A university can also charge students a student services and amenities fee (SSAF) which students can get a SA-HELP loan to cover (Australian Government Department of Education, 2023c).
