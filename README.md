![Build and Deploy](https://github.com/fusion809/fusion809.github.io/workflows/Build%20and%20Deploy/badge.svg)

This is a website I've created using Franklin. It is based on a [Franklin website template](https://github.com/tlienart/FranklinTemplates.jl), so not all of the code in this is my own.

I used to have a Jekyll-powered website, but Franklin has the following advantages over Jekyll:

* It is written and extended using a language I'm more fluent in than Jekyll's language (Ruby).
* It has in-built support for KaTeX. As most of my work now involves maths, TeX support is essential.
