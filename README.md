This is a website I have created using [Franklin](https://franklinjl.org). It is based on a [Franklin website template](https://github.com/tlienart/FranklinTemplates.jl), so not all of the code in this is my own.

I used to have a [Jekyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software))-powered website, but Franklin has the following advantages over Jekyll:

* It is written and extended using a language I am more fluent in than Jekyll's language (Ruby).
* It has in-built support for [KaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KaTeX). As most of my work now involves maths, TeX support is essential.
