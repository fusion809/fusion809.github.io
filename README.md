# fusion809.github.io
This is a website I've created using Franklin. It is based on the Franklin website template, so not all of the code in this is my own.

I used to have a Jekyll-powered website, but Franklin has the advantages:

* It is written and extended using a language I'm more fluent in than Jekyll's language (Ruby).
* It has in-built support for KaTeX. As most of my work now involves maths, TeX support is essential.
